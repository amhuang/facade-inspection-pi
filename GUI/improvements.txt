/* ----- IMPROVEMENTS TO DO ----- */

- Error message for when a camera disconnects
    - reset option for cameras if one breaks
    - rearranging order?
    - name cameras?

- Javascript respond when mouse leaves arrow spot

- MASTER SETTINGS in top right corner which do the following

    - keep track of how much string is let out and how much is let in. If someone tries to pull in more than has been let out, they shouldn't be able to. â€” more like max height that you can go to.
        - "building height limit reached. do you want to continue"
        - DISABLE event listeners for up hoist controls unless confirmed

    - duty cycle length (30min) and active cycle limit (15min)
        - active cycle = how much you can use it within a single duty cycle
        - timer that counts down for cooldown timer
        - override option

- backup reconnection speed

- livestream code as modular jquery


/* ----- COMPLETED ----- */

- "status" channel? Something so backupMQTT knows when to start if client on upper pi fails (distinction between the python/client failing on upper pi and the broker failing. Comparable situation to switching to backup if accelerometer disconnects from upper Pi)

- check leveling algorithm and see if it's behaving as expected

- Master settings - adjust IP addresses of pi

- Store time in session storage
    - sync time with pi every 10 sec
    - send if disocnnected, pi client crashes and needs to restart and resets time on Pi (send continuously to make sure Pi gets it first before it can send 0 to the GUI)

- required setting for TIME that string has been spooled out and notif when you're like 10 sec away from equal amounts of time sent down and up
